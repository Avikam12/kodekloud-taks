 (Please note that in case of bash script bash is the interpreter that is
 actually going to execute the script and the interpreter needs to read the
 script so even if you have given it only executable permission the 
 interpreter i.e bash will not be able to execute it so you had to give it 
 read permission as well along with execute permission.)
